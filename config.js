    title: "A Visual Timeline of the Opioid Crisis and Its Toll on Appalachia",
    byline: 'By Raanan Gurewitsch, Saumyadipta Pyne and Meghana Aruru',
    description: "Between 1979 and 2017, the average Appalachian county experienced a X% increase in yearly mortality rate, lowering the average life expectancy by X years. This trend was driven by an ongoing epidemic of addiction, overdose and suicide. A host of academic studies, lawsuits and investigations have laid blame on the opioid industry, specifically drug manufacturer Purdue Pharma.<br>In this story map, we use data from the Mortality Information Research Analytics database (MOIRA), a collection of American death certificates spanning nearly four decades. Specifically, we look at death rates from suicide, alcohol and drug overdose in the 420 counties of the Eastern United States that make up the Appalachian region. These rates of deaths of despair show how the Opioid Crisis cast a dark cloud over the region for twenty years, hitting many of the most vulnerable corners of the country.",
